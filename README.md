# ShutApp

>**ShutApp** is a real-time chat application that is being developed further.
>
>In this application, users can join a room by entering their _names_ and the _room name_
>that they want to join.   
>Users in the same room can chat with each other privately.

**Technologies used so far:**
- node.js
- express.js
- socket.io
- jQuery
- mustache.js
- Docker
- GitHub Actions
- HTML
- CSS

Next up, I am going add an authentication to join a room and connect a database (MongoDB) 
to this application.
